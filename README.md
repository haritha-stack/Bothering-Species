# Bothering-Species
Bothering animal species means harming or disturbing wildlife. Chasing, feeding, or getting too close stresses animals. Destroying homes with construction or pollution, illegal hunting, and littering hurt them too. This can harm populations and nature, even causing extinction. Laws protect them. Help by respecting wildlife and habitats
